## Blog Post Management
When adding a new blog post, always remember to:

1. **Update the homepage** (`index.html`):
   - Find the "Latest Blog Post" section (around line 35-40)
   - Update the blog post title in the h3 element
   - Update the "Read Now" button href to point to the new post URL
   - Follow the pattern: `/blog/[post-title-slug]/`

2. **Update LLMs.txt documentation**:
   - Find the "LATEST BLOG POST" section (around line 58-65)
   - Update Title, Date, URL, and Summary fields
   - Update the Main Points section with key takeaways

3. **Update the blog post excerpt**:
   - Replace the default excerpt with a descriptive summary of the post content
   - Target the intended audience (e.g., "Swift developers", "MLX users")
   - Keep it concise but informative (1-2 sentences)
   - Example: "A Swift developer's guide to understanding LLMs through their three core components: the inference engine, tokenizer, and model weights. Perfect for those exploring Apple's MLX framework."

4. **Directory naming**:
   - Use descriptive, slugified names that match the post title
   - Example: `demystifying-llms-for-swift-developers-part-1`
   - Avoid dates in directory names unless necessary

## File Structure
- Blog posts go in `_posts/[post-title-slug]/index.md`

- Homepage is `index.html`

## Jekyll Configuration
- Permalink structure: `/blog/:title/`
- Use kramdown for markdown processing

## Code Style
- Use proper HTML escaping in Jekyll templates
- Avoid escaped quotes (`\"`) in HTML files
- Keep front matter clean and properly formatted
